    <h2>Digital Product — Refunds</h2>
    <p>Because this is an instant digital product, we limit refunds to ensure fairness and to prevent misuse.</p>

    <h3>Our Standard Refund Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refunds will be considered within <strong>7 days</strong> of purchase only in cases where the digital product is defective (e.g., corrupted file, wrong file) or you did not receive the download link.</li>
      <li>To request a refund, email <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a> with your Order ID / Payment ID and describe the issue. We'll respond within 3 business days.</li>
      <li>If we confirm the issue, we will issue a refund via the original payment method. Processing time depends on the payment provider (Razorpay/bank), usually 5–10 business days.</li>
      <li>We do not offer refunds simply for “change of mind” after download, except at our discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cancellation</h3>
    <p>Purchases are processed immediately and delivery is instant, so orders cannot be canceled once the download link has been delivered.</p>

    <h3>Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>If you file a chargeback with your bank or payment provider without contacting us first, we will cooperate with Razorpay and the payment processor to provide evidence of delivery and any communications. Repeated abusive chargebacks may result in account restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>To request refunds or for cancellation questions: <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a></p>
